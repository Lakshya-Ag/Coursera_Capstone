# Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighbourhoods
## Analyzing the median house prices and School Ratings for the city of Scarborough in Canada for immigrants.

most diverse and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups
and places of worship

Many people migrating to various states of Canada require search of a good housing prices as well as good
rating schools for their children. The projects aim to create an analysis of features for a neighborhood as
a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median house price and school
ratings and recreational facilities. This would help people to get awareness of the places before moving
to a new country, state, city or place for their work or to start a new life
This Project would help people take a better decision on choosing the best neighborhood out of many
neighborhoods in Scarborough city based on the distribution of various facilities in and around that
neighborhood.
